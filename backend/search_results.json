This is in line with the recent measures to make the new tax regime a preferred tax regime. It would also create more disposable income for the taxpayers, strengthening their expenditure power.\"\nRC BHARGAVA, MARUTI SUZUKI CHAIRMAN, TO ETNOW\n\"The tax cut is going to be a helpful factor in accelerating demand for various kinds of consumer products.\"\nANITHA RANGAN, ECONOMIST, EQUIRUS\n\"While capex growth does not look very robust, implicit capex via long-term reforms shows promise. Simplification of direct taxes reforms will be announced in a week, but the icing on the cake came in the end with income tax relief to the middle class with direct tax foregone of 1 trillion rupees.\"\nRADHIKA RAO, DBS BANK, SENIOR ECONOMIST\n\"One of other major pillars was also to expand India's footprint in global supply chains and boost exports, towards which a re-assessment of regulatory reforms will be undertaken to improve the ease of doing business, along with further rationalisation in import tariffs.\"\n2024:\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman clocked in an hour and 25 minutes.\nInterim Budget 2024, Shortest Budget Speech:\nMs Sithraman presented her sixth consecutive budget with the shortest speech so far lasting 56 minutes.\n2023:\nMs Sitharaman completed the budget presentation in just 87 minutes.\n2022:\nNirmala Sitharaman's budget speech lasted for 92 minutes.\n2021, First Paperless Budget:\nThe 2021 budget speech lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes.

If there is a high fiscal deficit, it means the government is spending more than it earns and needs to borrow money to bridge this gap.\nTax Reforms\nTax reforms refer to changes and improvements in the tax system to make it more efficient, transparent, and fair. The government implements these reforms to make tax laws simpler. For example, in 2017, the government introduced GST and replaced multiple indirect taxes like VAT, Service tax, and excise duty.\nRead full cheat sheet here\nDirect Effects:\nIncome Tax Changes: Adjustments to tax slabs or rates directly affect take-home pay.\u00a0\u00a0Revisions in Deductions/Exemptions: Changes influence disposable income and savings potential.\u00a0\u00a0Capital Gains Tax Adjustments: Alterations impact returns on investments such as stocks, real estate, and bonds.\u00a0\u00a0Professional Tax/Surcharges: These changes particularly affect net earnings for higher-income groups.\u00a0\nIndirect Effects:\u00a0\u00a0\nInfrastructure Spending: Increased government spending on infrastructure generates jobs and drives income growth in sectors like construction and allied industries.\u00a0\u00a0Interest Rate Changes: Fluctuations affect borrowing costs (e.g., EMIs) and returns on savings, impacting disposable income.\u00a0\u00a0Sector-Specific Incentives: These can lead to higher wages and job opportunities in targeted industries.\u00a0Social Welfare Schemes: Additional income or support is provided to vulnerable groups, enhancing their financial stability.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe industry's expectations from the government from the Budget:\u00a0\nEmployment: The introduction of employee-linked incentive schemes and clarification on the implementation of new central labour codes are urgently needed.\nNational Retail Trade Policy: The swift adoption of this policy is essential to foster the growth of various retail formats and reduce regulatory burdens.\nFinance: The provision of affordable financing and lower interest rates for small retailers is key to nurturing sector stability and expansion.\nDigital Infrastructure: Continued support for initiatives like Digital India is expected, with policies that ensure fair competition between online and offline retailers and government investment in digital infrastructure to enhance e-commerce and retail technology.\nEvery Budget season, the most-asked question remains the same - does it have anything for the salaried class? With Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman set to present Budget 2025-26 on February 1, the salaried class is again looking out if the government has any plans to reduce their financial burden.\nEconomists have suggested that the government this time offer a higher tax exemption limit and an increased standard deduction under the new tax regime, which would benefit a lot of taxpayers. In the last Budget, the standard deduction was increased to Rs 75,000 from Rs 50,000 while the exemption limit stands at Rs 3 lakh under the new regime.\nRead more here\nIntroduction of wealth tax in the 1957-58 Budget\nThe 1957-58 Budget, presented by Finance Minister TT Krishnamachari, introduced a landmark reform - the wealth tax. For the first time, individuals were taxed on the value of their personal assets. The shift marked a new approach to taxation, aimed at reducing economic inequality by taxing the wealthy. The wealth tax remained in place for decades before it was scrapped in 2015.\nThe 'Black Budget' of 1973-74\nThe 1973-74 Budget, presented by Yashwantrao B Chavan, is remembered as the \"Black Budget\" for its staggering fiscal deficit of Rs 550 crore. India was grappling with serious economic challenges, including rising oil prices and food shortages. The Budget laid bare the country's economic difficulties, and it was a precursor to the political and economic turbulence that followed, including the declaration of the Emergency in 1975.\nRead more here\nNirmala Sitharaman has been supported by a skilled team of experts, each playing a crucial role in shaping the economic roadmap.\u00a0\nHere are the key figures behind the Budget-making process:\nV Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic AdviserManoj Govil, Expenditure SecretaryAjay Seth, Economic Affairs SecretaryTuhin Kanta Pandey, Finance and Revenue SecretaryArunish Chawla, DIPAM SecretaryM Nagaraju, Financial Services Secretary\nIndia's first Union Budget was presented on April 7, 1860, by James Wilson, the finance member of the Indian Council and the founder of The Economist newspaper. At the time, India was under British colonial rule, and the Budget was a response to the financial difficulties faced by the British administration following the First War of Indian Independence in 1857 (Sepoy Mutiny).\nIn the wake of the failed rebellion, Queen Victoria sent James Wilson to India to reform the financial system, introduce a tax structure, and implement a new paper currency. One of his key initiatives was the introduction of income tax, which continues to be a significant source of government revenue today.\nThe Union Budget is traditionally presented by the Finance Minister in the Lok Sabha every year, as mandated under Article 112 of the Constitution. But there have been occasions when the Prime Minister had to step in and table the Budget.\nThe first time this happened was in 1958 when Jawaharlal Nehru presented the Budget, after Finance Minister T.T. Krishnamachari was forced to resign following allegations of corruption and fraud in the Mundhra scam.\nMorarji Desai, who served as Prime Minister from 1977 to 1979, tabled it in 1978 after the resignation of Finance Minister C. Subramaniam.\nFormer Prime Minister Indira Gandhi also presented the Budget in 1970 when Morarji Desai resigned as Finance Minister in 1969.\nSimilarly, Rajiv Gandhi also tabled the Union Budget for FY 1987-88 after V.P. Singh stepped down as Finance Minister.\nParliament's Budget Session will held from January 31 to April 4.\nThe first part of the Budget Session will have nine sittings from January 31 to February 13 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will respond to the Motion of Thanks on the President's address and Sitharaman will reply to the discussion on the budget.\nParliament will then break for recess to examine the budget proposals and meet again from March 10 to discuss the demands for grants of various ministries and complete the budgetary process.\nWhile Lok Sabha has provisionally allotted two days (February 3-4) for discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President's address, Rajya Sabha has earmarked three days for the debate.\nThe session will conclude on April 4. The entire budget session will have 27 sittings.\u00a0\nThe government has listed 16 Bills, including the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, besides the financial business for the Budget session. Some of the other key bills listed for the session include the Banking Laws (Amendment) Bill, The Railways (Amendment) Bill, The Disaster Management (Amendment) Bill, The Oilfields (Regulation and Development) Amendment Bill, The Protection of Interests in Aircraft Objects Bill, and The Immigration and Foreigners Bill.\nThe leak of the Budget in 1950 remains one of the earliest and most significant instances in India's history. The event took place during the tenure of Finance Minister John Mathai, under the leadership of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\nAt that time, the printing of the Budget took place at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is the official residence of the President of India. After the leak, the venue for printing the Budget was shifted to a government press on Minto Road in Delhi to maintain secrecy.\u00a0\nLater, in 1980, the North Block basement at the capital's Secretariat Building became the permanent location for printing Budget papers.\nOver the last decade, India's sustained focus on infrastructure development, job creation and the rising middle class with higher disposable income has significantly improved its global economic standing, moving it from the 10th rank by GDP in 2014 to the fifth-largest today.\nAs the Indian economy aims to overtake Japan and Germany to be No. 3 in the world in three to four years, here's a bold prediction: our aviation and aerospace industry can fly us there sooner - as early as fiscal 2027. It is time for us to think bigger about airlines, airport infrastructure and aerospace manufacturing, and maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) and how they can be transformational for India.\nRead the opinion by Vikram Rai here\nDelhi: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman meets President Droupadi Murmu at Rashtrapati Bhavan before presenting the #UnionBudget2025.

Under the old tax regime, the basic income exemption limit is set at Rs 2.50 lakh, while in the new tax regime, the limit is Rs 3 lakh.\nWith the Economic Survey seeking financial inclusion for rural households and small businesses as a priority area, Nirmala Sitharaman may announce easier access to credit through microfinance institutions, self-help groups and other intermediaries.\nRevisiting tariff structures to support domestic manufacturing and reduce dependency on imports while helping manage exchange rate pressures are likely.\nThere is a very strong likelihood of Ms Sitharaman announcing policies and initiatives to accelerate progress in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).\nEconomists expect the Union Budget will unveil tariff reforms and consider a concessionary tax rate for new manufacturing facilities in India, both of which would address emerging global challenges but could have mixed implications for the domestic economy.\nA decision likely to be taken with an eye on US policies is some sort of corporate tax relief.\nMany analysts agree on one thing - the government will continue on the path of fiscal consolidation, with a projected fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for fiscal 2026.\nThe Budget preparation involves an intricate series of steps over several months.\nThe groundwork usually begins around August, when the Finance Ministry issues guidelines to various ministries, states, Union Territories and autonomous bodies.Once these proposals are submitted, they are meticulously reviewed by government officials. Extensive deliberations follow, ensuring the proposals are in line with the government's overall fiscal framework.If there is any disagreement on the allocation of funds, the matter is referred to the Union Cabinet or even the Prime Minister for resolution.\u00a0Consultations are held with various stakeholders, including business owners, farmers, economists and foreign institutional investors, through the Department of Economic Affairs and the Department of Revenue.The preparation also includes a series of pre-Budget meetings, where the Finance Minister engages with representatives from various sectors.The Finance Minister finalises the Budget, after which it is sent for printing, a milestone that is celebrated with a halwa ceremony.\nThe history of India's Union Budget dates back to 1860, when British parliamentarian James Wilson presented it for the first time. It was solely printed in English, catering to the colonial administration and its English-speaking audience.\nWith India's Independence in 1947, the government recognised the need to make such critical documents more accessible to a broader population. This led to several reforms over time, including the landmark decision to print the Budget in Hindi.\nThe Union Budget and Railway Budget were presented separately until 2017 when the government ended the 92-year-old practice and merged them. Arun Jaitley presented the first combined Budget for the fiscal year 2017-18, and since then the practice has become a norm.\nThe decision to merge the Railway Budget with the Union Budget was made in 2016, following the submission of a white paper titled 'Dispensing with the Railway Budget' by the NITI Aayog Committee chaired by Bibek Debroy. The paper was presented to Suresh Prabhu, calling for an end to the decades-old practice.\nThe merger of the Railway Budget with the Union Budget facilitated multimodal transport planning between highways, railways, and inland waterways and allow the Ministry of Finance greater elbow room for better allocation of resources.\nThe Budget can impact the rupee. Here are some ways:\nFiscal Deficit: A higher fiscal deficit can lead to more government borrowing, causing inflation and weakening the rupee. But a lower fiscal deficit boosts investor confidence and helps stabilise the rupee.\u00a0\nTax Policies: Tax changes, like higher capital gains taxes, can impact foreign investments. After the 2024 Budget increased taxes, foreign investors sold nearly $1 billion in Indian equities within two days, weakening the rupee.\nImport Duties: Changes in import duties can impact the demand for foreign currencies. Higher import duties may lower dollar demand by reducing imports, helping stabilise the rupee. EY's Chief Policy Advisor DK Srivastava suggested that raising import duties could help curb dollar demand and prevent the rupee from sliding further, PTI reported.\nMarket Sentiment: Budget announcements can affect investor sentiment. Positive policies can attract foreign investment, strengthening the rupee, while negative ones may lead to capital outflows and weaken the rupee.\nThe Direct Tax Code - a new income tax bill meant to simplify compliance for individual taxpayers - will be introduced separately, and not as part of the Union Budget 2025 to be delivered by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday morning, sources have told NDTV.\nThere had been reports the new tax code, or DTC, would be read out with the budget speech.\nTalk of a new direct tax code emerged when Ms Sitharaman presented the full 2024/25 budget in July; then she had said the goal was to make current income tax laws simpler to read and understand, and reduce the number of pages of the I-T Act of 1961 by a staggering 60 per cent.\nStartups in the country are once again looking towards the Modi 3.0 administration to streamline policies to propel the growth story. Here is what the Indian startup community anticipates from the upcoming budget:\nEase of doing businessSimplified tax regimeInfrastructure developmentBet on emerging technologiesEdtech startups need helpIntellectual property rightsAccess to credit\nWhen we think about government finances, taxes often come to mind. Income tax, GST, and customs duties are the most common examples. While these taxes are crucial to government revenue, they are not the only source of income.\nAhead of the Budget 2025, it's essential to understand the diverse range of non-tax revenue streams the government relies on to fund its activities.\nSome non-tax revenue sources are:\nEarnings from government-owned enterprises,\nInterest on loans,\nRoyalties from natural resources,\nDividends from investments, among others.\nAs the nation gears up for key announcements, one document that often gets overlooked but is incredibly valuable to understanding the government's fiscal plans is the 'Budget at a glance'.\nThe 'Budget at a glance' is a simple summary/overview of the Union Budget.\u00a0\nThe document helps the public quickly see the government's priorities. It highlights how much money will go to important sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. It also shows the expected income from taxes and other sources, and how the government plans to manage the country's finances.\nThe document is usually around 5 to 30 pages long and is concise and easy to read. It is usually available in PDF format after the announcement of the Budget in Parliament.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman called on President Droupadi Murmu ahead of the Budget presentation speech in the Parliament.

They suggest that Budget 2025 could provide a critical opportunity for the government to build on its progress in AI.\nWith past budgets laying the groundwork through initiatives such as the IndiaAI Mission, enhanced infrastructure support, and ethical AI frameworks, the focus should shift to implementation and expansion, they said.\u00a0\u00a0\nHari Balaji, Partner in Technology Consulting at EY India, explained the progress and future directions of the IndiaAI Mission. According to him, the IndiaAI Mission, with a significant allocation of Rs 10.4k crore, aims to enhance AI computing capacity, research, and innovation.\u00a0\nRead full story here\nIndian equities market opened flat this morning, staying cautious ahead of the Budget presentation.\nHere Is How Union Budget Influences Stock Market\nAhead of the Union Budget 2025, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has proposed the introduction of joint taxation for married couples. Under joint taxation, a married couple would be treated as a single taxable unit, allowing them to combine their incomes when filing tax returns, similar to systems already in place in countries like the US and the UK.\nThe proposed tax slabs for couples filing jointly are:\nUp to Rs 6 lakh: No tax\nRs 6-14 lakh: 5 per cent tax\nRs 14-20 lakh: 10 per cent tax\nRs 20-24 lakh: 15 per cent tax\nRs 24-30 lakh: 20 per cent tax\nAbove Rs 30 lakh: 30 per cent tax\nNirmala Sitharaman holds the record for delivering the longest Budget speech in India's history. In 2020, her speech lasted 2 hours and 42 minutes.\nFormer Finance Minister Hirubhai M Patel delivered the shortest Budget speech in 1977-78. Mr Patel's interim Budget speech contained just 800 words.\nIn 1991, Finance Minister Manmohan Singh delivered a Budget speech of 18,650 words. It's still the longest Budget speech by word count.\nJohn Maynard Keynes famously remarked, \"In the long run, we are all dead\". But in the short run, without capital expenditure, we are all just stuck in a low-equilibrium growth trap.Public investment in infrastructure, energy, and digital connectivity is the fundamental driver of productivity gains, crowding in private investment through enhanced factor mobility and network externalities.Yet, capital expenditure is often treated like a countercyclical stimulus-announced with great fanfare but under-executed due to fiscal constraints and bureaucratic inertia. Without sustained capital formation, an economy risks stagnating in a high-cost, low-productivity equilibrium-effectively turning Keynes' long-run fatalism into a self-fulfilling prophecy.Read the opinion by Aditya Sinha here\nPublic investment in infrastructure, energy, and digital connectivity is the fundamental driver of productivity gains, crowding in private investment through enhanced factor mobility and network externalities.\nYet, capital expenditure is often treated like a countercyclical stimulus-announced with great fanfare but under-executed due to fiscal constraints and bureaucratic inertia.

The key announcements from the 2024-25 budget, including measures to simplify taxation, reduce litigation, and improve tax certainty, have shown notable progress.\nReduction in Litigation and Appeals: Introduction of the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme, 2024, aimed at resolving pending income tax disputes.\nSimplification of Capital Gains Taxation: Introduction of only two holding periods: one year for listed assets and two years for unlisted and non-financial assets.\nReassessment and Reopening of Cases: Assessments can now only be reopened beyond three years if the escaped income exceeds Rs 50 lakh, with a maximum period of five years.\nComprehensive Review of the Income Tax Act, 1961: Complete overhaul of the Income Tax Act, 1961, to make it concise and easier to understand. Over 6,500 suggestions have been received from stakeholders.\nNirmala Sitharaman's journey from a middle-class upbringing to becoming one of the most powerful female leaders in Indian politics is a story of perseverance, intellect, and dedication.\nAccording to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Nirmala Sitharaman was born on 18th August 1959 in the temple town of Madurai, Tamil Nadu. She did her schooling and her graduation in economics from Seethalakshmi Ramaswamy College in Tiruchirapalli. She went on to do her master's in economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

During the Covid-19 crisis, the Budget focused on managing the pandemic's impact, while the 2011 Budget dealt with the Eurozone debt crisis. The 2025 Budget also comes with its own set of challenges, both domestic and global.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's February 1 Budget is expected to address key economic challenges, particularly inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) works to keep inflation within its 2-6 per cent tolerance range.\nIndia's economic growth for FY 26 is expected to be 6.7 per cent, according to government data released last week. It was primarily driven by moderating food prices. Despite this easing, the inflation rate remains above the RBI medium-term target of 4 per cent.\nThe stock markets will remain open for trading on Saturday, February 1, when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the Union Budget. Trading hours will follow the standard schedule from 9.15 am to 3.30 pm, according to separate circulars issued by NSE and BSE.\nTypically closed on weekends, stock markets occasionally operate on Saturdays for special events, such as the Union Budget. On February 1, 2020, and February 28, 2015, the Budgets were presented on Saturdays, and the market remained open.\nWith the Union Budget for FY26 scheduled to be presented on February 1, 2025, a report by Goldman Sachs underlined two key concerns for policymakers, the pace of fiscal consolidation and the government's spending priorities.\nThe report highlighted that the upcoming budget will be crucial for balancing growth and fiscal discipline as India stands out for its high levels of public debt and fiscal deficit as compared with other emerging markets.\nGoldman Sachs noted that the government is likely to keep the fiscal consolidation path intact, driven by the need to manage high public debt-to-GDP ratios. However, the report cautioned that this fiscal tightening could act as a drag on economic growth in the upcoming fiscal year.\nFinance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present her eighth consecutive Union Budget on February 1. She has since delivered seven consecutive budgets along with one interim Budget in February 2024.\nMorarji Desai, who served as finance minister from 1959 to 1963 and again from 1967 to 1969, holds the record for the most budgets presented by an individual - 10 in total, including two interim budgets.\nP Chidambaram holds the record for presenting the second-highest number of Union Budgets, with a total of nine.\nAs the Union Budget 2025 approaches, the education sector is brimming with expectations for transformative initiatives to enhance learning infrastructure and accessibility. The previous year's allocation of Rs 1.12 lakh crore to education prioritised digital learning, virtual labs, and the Digital University initiative. This year, experts are calling for continued investments to modernise the sector.\nGeeta Jayanth, Principal of Chaman Bhartiya School, expressed hopes for increased funding for teacher training, experiential learning programmes, STEM labs, and smart classrooms.\nThe Budget allocation for education, employment and skilling in 2024 was Rs 1.48 lakh crore. Of this, the highest allocation of Rs 73,498 crore was made to the Department of School Education and Literacy. From 2015-2024, India has been allocating over 4 per cent of its GDP to education sector.\u00a0 On the other hand, US spends 5 per cent while Canada, Japan and Germany spend 5.5 per cent, 3.6 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively.\u00a0\nA skilled and educated population will result in increase in the GDP of the country. Experts have noted that as per previous trends, all developed countries have diverted a large fund towards public education system.\nAreas that need increased allocation include:\nDigital InfrastructureTeacher TrainingSkill Development Programs\n#WATCH | #BudgetSession | PM Narendra Modi says, \"You must have noticed, since 2014, this is the first Parliament session, which saw no 'videshi chingari' (foreign interference) in our affairs, in which no foreign forces tried to ignite a fire.

It may come up with policies for better implementation of Minimum Support Price (MSP) to help the farmers.\nOn Healthcare, Education\nFunding may be raised for the centre's flagship health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat. The government may also increase allocation for the implementation of the National Education Policy 2020, skill development, and research and development.\nOn Climate Change\nThe budget may focus on providing incentives for renewable energy projects as the country aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. This may include tax benefits and subsidies on EV manufacturing, DeepSeek said. Other areas of focus may be water conservation and waste management, for which funding may be increased.\nRead here\nAhead of the start of the Budget Session, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India will fulfil its aim of Viksit Bharat and this Budget Session will give new energy and hope to the nation.\nIn his customary address to the media before the beginning of a new session, PM Modi said, \"Ahead of the Budget Session, I bow down to Maa Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity..\"\nReminiscing the Maha Lakshmi mantra, PM Modi said that he prays to the Goddess to have special blessings on the poor and the middle class.\nWhile Manmohan Singh's 1991 Union Budget ended the Licence Raj, opening the Indian economy to the world, P Chidambaram's presentation was labelled a \"Dream Budget\" for the relief it brought to the taxpayer.\nThe same couldn't be said about Indira Gandhi's 1973-74 Budget, which, in the annals of Indian economic history, is referred to as the \"Black Budget\".\nPresented by Yashwantrao B Chavan, the then Finance Minister, the Budget received the infamous nickname due to the massive fiscal deficit of Rs 550 crore, an unprecedented figure which underscored the country's economic challenges.\nRead here\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India  and around the world",

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting it before the Parliament soon. \nAhead of the Budget, Congress MP Manish Tewari says: \u201cThe Budget is very simply an accounting statement \u2014 it states as to how much the govt spent and how much it earned. Whether there is a surplus or there is a deficit. But unfortunately, over the years, this has become a once-in-a-year podium for the Finance Minister to grandstand and to talk about motherhood and apple pie. Coupled with that, television channels have turned it into a spectacle, primarily because it has become an event to collect revenue and boost TRP. But, at the end of it, as every advanced economy, the Budget is a non-event because it is merely a statement of account and expenditure...\u201d \nOn reaching Parliament for the Budget, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi says: \u201cEver since economy of this country started being taken care of under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, we have given pro-people, pro-poor, pro-middle class Budgets.

Tax Relief and Rationalisation: There is a strong expectation of income tax cuts or adjustments, particularly to ease the burden on the lower and middle class, which has been struggling with high prices and stagnant wages. Measures may also include tax rationalisation and customs duty cuts to promote local manufacturing.\n2. Boosting Consumption and Growth: The budget is expected to focus on boosting domestic consumption and economic growth, while maintaining fiscal prudence. This may involve measures to encourage private sector investment, increase job creation, and stimulate consumer spending, particularly in urban areas.\n3. Infrastructure and Capital Expenditure: There is an anticipated increase in capital expenditure, especially in sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure, which are key to driving economic activity. Infrastructure upgrades and better capital spending execution are expected to be prioritized.\n4. Support for Exports and Manufacturing: To enhance India\u2019s global competitiveness, tariff rationalisation and duty exemptions could be introduced. Measures to streamline export compliance processes and incentivize local manufacturing are expected to help bolster export activity.\n5. Focus on Skilling and Employment: The government is likely to prioritize skill development and employment generation, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, to strengthen the agricultural value chain and address structural supply-side challenges that contribute to inflation. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has reached the Parliament as everyone gears up for the Budget. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be presenting the Budget soon. \nAhead of presentation of Union Budget 2025, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi says: \u201cI wish her (Nirmala Sitharaman) all the best because she is going on to create a new record. I hope she keeps interests of the people in mind when she presents the Budget today, understands the responsibilities she has. Over 1.4 billion people are looking at this day in a very important way, because it changes their financial situation...\u201d \nAs Sensex opened about 1,000 points higher, from the 30-share blue-chip pack, ITC Hotels, IndusInd Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Sun Pharma, UltraTech Cement and NTPC were among the biggest gainers.

A cut or tweak in income tax rates/slabs to ease the burden of the middle class is on the cards. This is also the Narendra Modi government\u2019s first full-year budget in the third term and is being presented against the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties and slowing of the economic growth rate to a four-year low. \nUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has left for Parliament to table the Budget after meeting President Droupadi Murmu. \nAhead of presenting her Budget before Parliament, Union Finance Minister met President Droupadi Murmu after leaving from North Block. \nIn case you are wondering how your income tax will be affected once the Budget is announced, we have got you covered. Just head over to the given link, fill in the details and find out which tax slab you fall under: https://indianexpress.com/income-tax-calculator/ \nIndia\u2019s benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty have opened in the green ahead of Budget presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The Nifty 50 was up 0.13 per cent at 23,541.3 points, as of 9:15 am IST, while the BSE Sensex added 0.18% to 77,637.01. The debt and forex markets will remain closed. \nUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has left the Ministry of Finance after the customary photograph with this year\u2019s Budget. \nThe government is expected to focus on improving credit accessibility and extending incentives and subsidies to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the upcoming Budget. Discussions ahead of the FY26 Budget have emphasized these measures, which aim to bolster the sector. The employment-linked incentive scheme, introduced in the FY25 Budget but yet to be fully implemented, is anticipated to receive renewed attention. This initiative will be vital for accelerating employment growth in MSMEs, many of which have not yet recovered to their pre-pandemic employment levels. \nGiven that MSMEs play a crucial role in India\u2019s labour-intensive export sector \u2014 contributing around 45% of the country\u2019s total exports \u2014 the Budget is expected to introduce further support for export-driven MSMEs. This may include the extension of subsidies and incentives, designed to strengthen the sector and enhance its global competitiveness. \nUnion Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has arrived at North Block ahead of presenting the Union Budget before the Parliament. \nAs the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman rises in Parliament today to present her eighth consecutive Budget, the most by any Finance Minister, there are rising expectations of some form of relief measures \u2014 for small industry and taxpayers, especially the vocal \u201cmiddle class\u201d. \nGiven the government\u2019s stated stance about fiscal prudence and the restricted fiscal space to sharply increase spending, a big fiscal stimulus is unlikely. However, a tweak in income tax slabs for lower income levels, incentives for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and a thrust on capital expenditure are expected to be the key tools to be deployed by the government to fix the faltering growth engine.\nTax Relief\nThe pre-Budget meetings in the ministries held in the national capital including the one chaired by the Prime Minister last month saw many participants admitting to India being a heavily taxed country. In the policy circle, India's need to lower both direct and indirect taxes has been discussed in detail, while maintaining the need for the government to maintain the required pace of fiscal consolidation.\nA relief on the front of personal income tax in the Budget, either in the form of a higher standard deduction or a tweak in rate slabs, especially at lower income levels to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people, are all measures that could spur consumption. The government is also expected to provide a broad outline of its roadmap for rate rationalisation on the indirect tax front under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, even as it cannot announce any specific rate change as part of the Budget. \nThe measure could help accommodate the rising spending needs of the middle class, which have reeled under the impact of elevated inflation and stagnant wage growth. (Aanchal Magazine writes)\nIndia\u2019s 2024 Union Budget had introduced several key measures aimed at stimulating economic growth, enhancing employment, and supporting various sectors. Here are ten important highlights:\n1. Tax Revisions: The budget revised income tax slabs under the new tax regime, increasing the standard deduction for salaried employees from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. Additionally, the deduction on family pension for pensioners was enhanced from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. Assessments can now be reopened beyond three years up to five years from the end of the assessment year, only if the escaped income exceeds \u20b950 lakh. The new tax regime rate structure was also revised to provide salaried employees with benefits up to \u20b917,500 in income tax. \n2. Agriculture and Rural Development: The government allocated Rs 2.66 trillion for rural development, focusing on enhancing agricultural productivity and resilience. This includes transforming agriculture research, releasing new crop varieties, and promoting natural farming practices. \n3. Employment Generation: To boost employment, the Budget introduced measures such as providing one-month wages to new entrants in all formal sectors in three installments up to Rs 15,000, expected to benefit 21 million youth. Additionally, the government said it will reimburse EPFO contributions of employers up to Rs 3,000 per month for two years for all new hires, aiming to generate 5 million jobs. \n4. Infrastructure Development: The budget emphasized infrastructure development, including the completion of the Polavaram Irrigation Project to ensure food security. Additionally, the government plans to develop three major railway corridors and expand and develop new airports. \n5. Privatisation Plans: The government is pivoting from previous plans of extensive privatization of state-run companies, opting instead to invest billions to revive several of these firms. Plans include $1.5 billion in rescue packages for two state-owned companies, including a significant investment in helicopter operator Pawan Hans. \n7. Capital Gains Tax: The Budget had proposed changes to the capital gains tax structure, increasing the tax rate on short-term capital gains from 15% to 20% and setting the long-term capital gains tax rate at 12.5%. Additionally, the exemption limit for long-term capital gains was raised from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.25 lakh. \n8. Angel Tax Abolition: The government had abolished the \u201cangel tax\u201d, a levy that applied to investments received by unlisted companies exceeding the fair market value of their shares, often affecting start-ups and early-stage companies.\nChief Economic Advisor Dr V Anantha Nageswaran has arrived at the Ministry of Finance. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Union Budget in Parliament today. \nIndia\u2019s economy is holding steady despite global uncertainties, according to the latest Economic Survey. The country's real GDP growth for FY25 is projected at 6.4%, with a slightly higher forecast for FY26 between 6.3% and 6.8%. The survey highlights that private final consumption expenditure, which reflects consumer demand, is expected to rise from 60.3% in FY24 to 61.8% in FY25, marking the highest share since FY03.\nOn the supply side, India\u2019s Gross Value Added (GVA) is performing close to its decadal average. In FY25\u2019s first quarter, GVA surpassed its pre-pandemic trend and continues to stay above it, indicating strong economic activity. \nInflation is moderating, primarily due to a decrease in core inflation, which excludes food and fuel. However, food inflation has risen from 7.5% in FY24 to 8.4% in FY25, driven by supply chain disruptions and weather-related issues. Despite this, economic advisors note that excluding certain volatile items like vegetables and pulses, inflation could align more closely with the target of 4%. Overall, while food inflation poses a challenge, India\u2019s broader economic performance remains resilient.\n1. Tax Relief and Rationalisation: There is a strong expectation of income tax cuts or adjustments, particularly to ease the burden on the lower and middle class, which has been struggling with high prices and stagnant wages. Measures may also include tax rationalisation and customs duty cuts to promote local manufacturing.\n2. Boosting Consumption and Growth: The budget is expected to focus on boosting domestic consumption and economic growth, while maintaining fiscal prudence. This may involve measures to encourage private sector investment, increase job creation, and stimulate consumer spending, particularly in urban areas.\n3. Infrastructure and Capital Expenditure: There is an anticipated increase in capital expenditure, especially in sectors like manufacturing and infrastructure, which are key to driving economic activity. Infrastructure upgrades and better capital spending execution are expected to be prioritized.\n4. Support for Exports and Manufacturing: To enhance India's global competitiveness, tariff rationalisation and duty exemptions could be introduced. Measures to streamline export compliance processes and incentivize local manufacturing are expected to help bolster export activity.\n5. Focus on Skilling and Employment: The government is likely to prioritize skill development and employment generation, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, to strengthen the agricultural value chain and address structural supply-side challenges that contribute to inflation.\nThe Economic Survey 2024-25 highlights the vulnerability of India's low-skill workforce to artificial intelligence (AI) and calls for \u201crobust institutions\u201d to help transition workers to medium-and-high-skilled jobs where AI can complement, rather than replace, their efforts. It proposes creating \u201cstewarding institutions\u201d that are agile and cross-sectoral to balance innovation and public welfare while managing the opportunities and threats posed by emerging technologies. The Survey emphasizes the need to revise regulatory frameworks to ensure AI aligns with societal values while maintaining accountability and transparency.\nThe Survey also calls for industry-academia partnerships, continuous skill development, and flexible learning models to prepare a globally competitive workforce. It warns that if companies fail to manage AI introduction sensitively, there will be strong demands for policy intervention.\nIn case you have missed the Economic Survey for 2024-25, we have got you covered. Here are 10 key points from the Economic Survey tabled by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman yesterday:\n1. Global Challenges: The Survey flags global economic challenges, including slower global trade and investment due to rising protectionism and China's dominance in manufacturing.\n2. Global Trade Shift: The world is moving away from the era of outsourcing manufacturing to China, which could benefit India as global supply chains reset.\n3. Indian Economy: Despite global uncertainties, India\u2019s economy remains steady, with Real GDP growth for FY25 at 6.4%, and projected to be between 6.3% and 6.8% in FY26.\n4. Consumer Demand: Private final consumption expenditure, representing consumer demand, is expected to rise to 61.8% of GDP in FY25, the highest since FY03.\n5. GVA Growth: India\u2019s Gross Value Added (GVA) growth has surpassed pre-pandemic trends and remains close to the decadal average.\n6. Inflation: Headline inflation is moderating due to lower core inflation, but food inflation has increased to 8.4%, driven by supply disruptions and weather issues.\n7. Employment: India\u2019s labour market is improving post-pandemic, with metrics such as unemployment rate, labour force participation, and worker-to-population ratio showing positive trends.\n8. Deregulation: The Survey stresses the need to deregulate the economy to foster growth, reduce business costs, and boost employment and consumption.\n9. Business Reforms: The Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) highlights the link between reforms and industrial activity, suggesting that deregulation is key for emerging states.\n10. Call for Action: While optimistic about recovery, the Survey warns that India faces limitations in producing critical goods for its infrastructure and investment needs. Deregulation is crucial to avoid stagnation.\nA Union Budget can shape a country's economic trajectory by influencing both the behavior of citizens and businesses. It can do this in two key ways: taxation and government spending.\nFirst, the government can adjust who it taxes and by how much. For example, lowering taxes for specific sectors could boost economic activity, create jobs, and increase overall prosperity. This can potentially lead to higher revenues even with lower tax rates, as increased business activity compensates for the reduced rates.\nSecond, the government can influence the economy by deciding where and how much to spend. A budget can signal a government\u2019s priorities, particularly early in a new term. In recent years, the government aimed to spur private sector investment by providing corporate tax breaks and increasing infrastructure spending. However, this approach didn\u2019t yield the expected investment boost because overall demand for goods and services remained weak due to economic and employment challenges.\nGiven these conditions, the government might shift its focus towards boosting consumption by common people rather than further incentivizing businesses. Stimulating consumer demand could, in turn, encourage businesses to invest. A balanced budget strategy can thus play a pivotal role in addressing economic challenges and promoting growth. \nThe Budget matters because it directly concerns the money of taxpayers, not the government\u2019s own funds. As British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once noted, the government has no source of money other than what citizens earn. When the government spends, it does so by either borrowing from citizens' savings or taxing them. This means any fiscal deficit, or borrowing to cover expenses, adds to the debt that current and future generations of citizens will ultimately repay.\nThe Budget highlights critical aspects that affect everyone, such as taxation policies, spending priorities, and government subsidies. It is crucial for citizens to pay attention to who gets taxed, how much is spent on essential sectors like education and healthcare, and whether subsidies reach those who truly need them. The government\u2019s fiscal policies determine the nation\u2019s financial health, much like how individuals manage their own finances.\nMonitoring the Budget is essential because, over time, careful fiscal management can lead to robust economic growth and stability. Conversely, neglecting financial prudence could lead to economic instability, as seen in the contrasting fiscal health of countries like India and Pakistan over decades. The Budget shapes not just the present, but the economic future of the country. \nBefore we get into the jargons and economics, let us first understand what the Budget is and what it aims to achieve. In simple terms, the Budget is a financial exercise where the government informs Parliament and the public about its income, expenditure, and borrowing. It reviews the previous financial year, detailing how much was earned, spent, and borrowed. Additionally, it provides estimates for the upcoming financial year, outlining expected income, planned spending, and anticipated borrowing to cover any shortfall. Essentially, the Budget is a reflection of the government's financial health and plans. \nGood morning and welcome to our Live Blog covering the Union Budget.
