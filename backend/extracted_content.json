            "Union Budget 2025 Highlights: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday presented the Budget for the third term of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government, providing significant tax relief to the salaried middle class that was struggling with high prices and stagnant wages. Making a slew of announcements, Ms Sitharaman said individuals having an annual income of Rs 24 lakh or more can hope to save Rs 1.10 lakh in income tax, while those earning Rs 12 lakh will have to pay no tax, benefiting to the tune of Rs 80,000 from next fiscal under the new regime. She also said the government will introduce a new Income Tax bill in Parliament next week, replacing the six-decade old income tax act of 1961. The Union Budget 2025-26 envisaged an expenditure of Rs 50,65,345 crore, an increase of 7.4% over the current fiscal. The 2024-25 expenditure (Revised Estimates) is Rs 47.16 lakh crore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi l auded the Union Budget as a \"people's budget\" that puts more money in the hands of people, and said it is a force-multiplier that will increase investments and lead to growth. \"The Budget lays a strong foundation to increase savings and make citizens partners in development,\" he said. Intelligence gathering has taken a back seat in the Union Budget 2025-26 as the Centre has reduced the flow of funds of several verticals that deal with intelligence collection and dissemination, including the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) - the apex body for all matters concerning internal and external security. According to Notes on Demand for Grants (2025-26), Rs 182.75 crore has been allocated to NSCS in comparison to Rs 270.08 crore (revised estimate) last financial year. The budget of the Intelligence Bureau was also reduced by around Rs 100 crore. Click here to read more .

But if you're not, then I'm afraid there's nothing in the budget for you,\" said Mr Tharoor in an exclusive conversation with NDTV. \"If you're unemployed, like a very large percentage of our middle class, young people who are looking for jobs, the record amount of college-educated in our country who can't find jobs, there's nothing there for you because there's no encouragement whatsoever for jobs to come forth,\" he added.

This saree is made from Bangalore silk and features designs representing coupled fish and the lotus. Mithilanchal is famous for makhana, fish, and paan, which are of great cultural significance. Today, as the Finance Minister wears this saree, it fills us all with immense pride,\" she said. The handloom saree was given to Ms Sitharaman during her visit to the Mithila Painting Institute in Saurath on November 29 last year. The Budget document specifies that the new slabs are for those opting for the New Tax Regime, in line with the Centre's push for this new regime that aims to simplify personal tax by doing away with the complications of exemptions. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman or the Budget document does not mention the old tax regime, meaning slabs in the old regime remain unchanged. For high-salaried individuals, the new slabs provide a benefit of over Rs 1 lakh. Taking an example, an individual earning Rs 50 lakh per annum, will now be paying income tax of Rs 10,80,000 as per the revised slabs, Rs 1,10,000 less than what he currently pays. That effectively means the new slabs are aimed at putting more money in the hands of the middle-income group too boost consumption and provide marginal relief to high-salaried individuals. In the new proposals, there will be no tax burden on up to Rs 12 lakh annual income while the revised slabs will benefit those earning more than that. The changes are part of the Budget presentation by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday. Announcing the budget, the Finance Minister said taxpayers with Rs 12 lakh annual income will get a benefit of Rs 80,000 and those earning Rs 18 lakh will get a benefit of Rs 70,000 under the new slabs. They will also enjoy the additional benefit of Rs 75,000 standard deduction.
