# **Fact-Checker AI: Real-Time Misinformation Detection System**

## **Overview**
Fact-Checker AI is an advanced misinformation detection and fact-checking application designed to verify the credibility of online content. It leverages **machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), web scraping, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to provide **real-time validation of text-based information** shared on social media and other digital platforms.  

This system aims to **reduce the spread of misinformation**, enhance **user trust in online content**, and offer **scalable, automated verification** tools for individuals, businesses, and media organizations.  

## **Key Features**
- **Automated Fact-Checking**: Uses AI-driven models to analyze and validate text-based content.  
- **Real-Time Web Scraping**: Gathers relevant data from trusted online sources to cross-check claims.  
- **LLM-Based Analysis**: Employs large language models (LLMs) to understand context and assess credibility.  
- **Database Integration**: Stores validated fact-checking results for future references and model improvement.  
- **User-Friendly API**: Enables seamless integration with third-party applications for fact verification.

## **System Architecture**
The system follows a structured flow, as illustrated in the provided architecture:

1. **User Input**:  
   - The user submits a text/article for verification.  
   - The system processes the request and determines the best validation approach.  

2. **LLM Model Processing**:  
   - The input is analyzed using an **LLM (Large Language Model)** for context understanding.  
   - If additional verification is required, the system proceeds with data retrieval.  

3. **Web Scraper Module**:  
   - A web scraping tool fetches relevant information from trusted sources.  
   - The extracted data is sent for processing.  

4. **Data Processing and Validation**:  
   - The retrieved data is structured and processed to determine credibility.  
   - NLP and RAG techniques help cross-check the accuracy of claims.  

5. **Gen AI Model**:  
   - A **Generative AI model** evaluates the processed data to generate insights.  
   - The model flags misinformation and provides fact-based responses.  

6. **Database Integration**:  
   - All verified information is stored in a database for learning and future verification.  
   - The system continuously improves based on historical data.  

7. **User Output**:  
   - The verified response is presented to the user in a clear and concise format.  
   - The user can see whether the input content is **true, false, or requires further verification**.
